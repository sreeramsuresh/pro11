                In 2008, Mohanlal secretly underwent 18 months of escape artist training under famous magician Gopinath Muthukad.[150] He had planned to perform a stunt called "Burning Illusion" in Thiruvananthapuram. However, due to pressure from various quarters including his fans, the act was cancelled later on criticisms and allegations that it is extremely dangerous. The event was jointly organised by the Kerala Police, State Tourism Department and the Kerala State Youth Welfare Board

                The open-air "fire escape" stunt, which should have been held at the Chandrasekharan Nair Stadium, was a curtain-raiser for the four-day "Vismayam 2008", an international convention in which nearly 1,000 magicians from across the world took part. The meet started on 1 May. In the stunt, he was to be handcuffed and the whole body wrapped in chains with the keys in the hands of dignitaries watching the show. The actor would then be put inside a box, which would be then thrown into a ball of fire from where he had to escape.[151]

                The news shocked and split the magician community in Kerala. Before the commencement of the act, the internationally acclaimed magician Samraj advised Mohanlal against performing the stunt. Samraj approached the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) with a memorandum signed by 300 magicians, requesting it to urge Mohanlal to withdraw from the performance.[152] AMMA president and actor Innocent, requested that Mohanlal withdraw from the stunt to avoid endangering himself. He said: "Mohanlal is a pillar of the Malayalam film industry; he has no right to go and do such a risky show".[153] The stunt was also to inspire the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination. Briefing about the act in the press conference organised in Trivandrum, Mohanlal said: "The risk factor is fifty-fifty for the escape act. I hope that I can make it with the blessings of all".[154] About the objective of the act, the Merlin Award-winning magician Gopinath Muthukad said: "Counted as one of the most dangerous acts, the "Burning Illusion" will find Mohanlal inspiring the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination. He has been practising for a while to perfect it".[155]

                In 2014, the actor decided to perform a risk-free item for the inaugural function of Magic Planet, a magic-themed complex at Kinfra Film and Video Park in Kazhakoottam, Trivandrum. It was a project of the Academy of Magical Sciences, founded by his teacher, the internationally acclaimed magician Gopinath Muthukad. The function was inaugurated by the then sitting Chief Minister of Kerala Oommen Chandy and the first magic performance was done by Mohanlal. In the trick, he lifted a girl on air. Opposition Leader V. S. Achuthanandan along with other supreme leaders and high-profile international magicians were present at the function.[156]
